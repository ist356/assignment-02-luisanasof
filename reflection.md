## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

The packaging program part of this assignment was a very tough nut to crack for me (hence why I ended up cloning two other versions of the assignment in order to start from scratch). What helped me, though, was going back into the slides and doing each of the challenges, because this assignment built off of these exercises. 

The packaging program was a great exercise in learning for loops. I gained a much better understanding of how they work and the ways they can be used in automation. It really put me into the mindset of thinking through the code. Something else that helped me with this was debugging. I not only learned how to properly debug the program but how to think through the value of a variable and how this valul changes as it goes through a 'for' loop.

Finally, the actual program taught me how to apply these skills to a working code program and helped me practice my file output skills which, again, built off of the exercises in the slides. At this pt, though, it wasn't just calling the functions but also thinking through how and in what order to call them in order for the program to work properly. Had to understand what role they played in the bigger context of said program given the goal of creating a json file to  output the analyzed packaging text into.
